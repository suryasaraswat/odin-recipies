       <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>Onigiri are riceballs, staple of the Japanese bento. We can make the Onigiri even more tastier by mixing it with other ingredients like veggies and pickles.</p>
       <p>According to the Wikipedia:
        <blockquote>Onigiri is a Japanese rice ball made from white rice. It is usually formed into triangular or cylindrical shapes, and wrapped in nori. Onigiri traditionally have sour or salty fillings such as umeboshi (pickled Chinese plum), salted salmon, katsuobushi (smoked and fermented bonito), kombu, tarako or mentaiko (pollock roe), or takanazuke (pickled Japanese giant red mustard greens).</blockquote>

       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>4 cups uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>5 Â½ cups water, divided</li>
        <li>2 sheets nori (dry seaweed), cut into 1/2-inch strips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds </li>
       </ul>

       <h2>Steps</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Wash rice in a mesh strainer until water runs clear. Combine washed rice and 4 1/2 cups water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low; cover, and simmer rice until water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Let rice rest for 15 minutes to continue to steam and become tender. Allow cooked rice to cool. </li>
        <li>Combine remaining 1 cup water with salt in a small bowl; use to dampen hands before handling rice. Divide cooked rice into 8 equal portions. Use one portion of rice for each onigiri.</li>
        <li>Divide one portion of rice in two. Create a dimple in rice and fill with a heaping teaspoon of bonito flakes. Cover with remaining portion of rice and press lightly to enclose filling inside rice ball. Gently press rice to shape into a triangle; wrap with a strip of nori and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Repeat with remaining portions of rice. </li>
       </ol>

       <h2>Description</h2>
       <p>Onigiri are riceballs, staple of the Japanese bento. We can make the Onigiri even more tastier by mixing it with other ingredients like veggies and pickles.</p>
       <p>According to the Wikipedia:
        <blockquote>Onigiri is a Japanese rice ball made from white rice. It is usually formed into triangular or cylindrical shapes, and wrapped in nori. Onigiri traditionally have sour or salty fillings such as umeboshi (pickled Chinese plum), salted salmon, katsuobushi (smoked and fermented bonito), kombu, tarako or mentaiko (pollock roe), or takanazuke (pickled Japanese giant red mustard greens).</blockquote>
